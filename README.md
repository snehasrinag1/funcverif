This is a testbench which verifies the correct operation of D-FF. It first applies reset to the flip-flop and then applies input to din input port of flipflop and then collects output information from dout ouput port of flip-flop and checks the data in scoreboard and prints if design is functioning properly according to design spec of D-FF.

Test Plan for D-FF:

A test case for a D flip-flop called "D Flip-Flop Basic Operation" has been outlined. This test case verifies the fundamental functionality of the D flip-flop, ensuring that it correctly captures and outputs the D input on the rising edge of the clock signal. The test steps include initializing the flip-flop, applying inputs, verifying the output transitions, and repeating the process with different D input values to ensure consistent behavior. This test case helps ensure that the D flip-flop operates as expected in capturing and holding data with respect to clock edges.
